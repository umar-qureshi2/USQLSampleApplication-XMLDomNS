Please run the scripts in the given order (for example running script-1 first and then run script-2, since there are some data dependencies).
The purpose of this script is to give you a taste of the new Big Data query language U-SQL. You can always get the newest version of this lab from the link below:

/*
Creating a table is similar to creating a table in a relational database such as SQL Server. You either create a table with a predefined schema or create a table and infer the schema from the query that populates the table (also known as CREATE TABLE AS SELECT or CTAS).

Now let's decide to persist the searchlog data in a schematized format in a table called Searchlog in your own database. 
The script 
1. Creates the database
2. Sets the context to the created database
3. Creates the table. 
4.Insert the data into SearchLog table.

**Note that you currently cannot run a SELECT on a table in the same script as the script where you create that table.**
